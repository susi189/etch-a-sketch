**About this project**

This is one more of my early projects. This is a very simple version of a [Etch-A-Sketch tool](https://susi189.github.io/etch-a-sketch/index.html). To begin drawing click the "New board" button, choose the size of the board and start drawing.

Here I learned more about

- DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript
- CSS Grid
- Adding and removing event listners
